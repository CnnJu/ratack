				<p>Ra Tack's work invites the viewer into a lush, timeless world that is at the same time familiar and fantastic, an utopia full of longing. Melancholic and mystical, Tack's paintings deal with themes of transition, duality, longing and still life. Often working series, the works are oil paintings and mixed media on canvas and paper. Series carry the intensity and romanticism of impressionism with a confronting absence of ecological impulse. As works they are standing as juxtapositions to an ontological longing.<br/>
				In this perspective a reflection of isolation and dislocation..<br/>
				Oscillating between abstraction and representation, Tack weaves imaginative landscapes and natural phenomena with colors as textures. Tack's work speaks to what Jung calls a 'collective unconsciousâ€™, placing recognizable images in their own created myths and visual poems.<br/>
