				<p>Tack’s canvases are constellations of marks formed from hours of looking outward across Iceland’s dramatic landscapes <br>
					and inward to trace the emotional journeys one goes on. Steeped in the atmosphere of the fjords, Tack’s paint seems to rise out of the earth. <br>
					Stem-like streaks dance on an oversaturated cadmium yellow horizon while punches of optimistic floral reds exhale across the canvas, <br>
					elsewhere dense mycorrhizal nests fester. Many canvases hold these conflicting states within them, as we all do, <br>
					making them like characters, Tack avatars, that take on the atmosphere of the room they are in.  <br><br>Words by Jack Smurthwaite from press release duo exhibition <i>And as always, the end is everything.</i><br><br>
